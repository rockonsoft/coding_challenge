# Hello Api

## Challenge

- install the axios package with npm (Node package manager)
- confirm the version installed by checking the updates to the package.json
- use the axios package to make an http request to fetch published book information from google:
  - read the google books api: with an http GET request: https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q=harry&maxResults=10
  - Hint try the api in the browser first
  - List out all the titles off all the books that matches your api (the q parameter)
  <!-- www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes' and query string {'q': searchTerm, 'orderBy':'relevance', 'langRestrict':'en', 'maxResults':'40' }); -->
